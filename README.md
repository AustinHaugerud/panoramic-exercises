# Structure

This is split into major portions `Exercise1` and `Exercise2`. Each are
structured as if their modules were within a project for major concepts
like types/data structures in `Data`, Halogen hooks and components in
`Hook` and `Component` respectfully.

# Running

Run `yarn` to install dependencies. Given `yarn start` a local dev server 
should open on port `1234`. If this port is already taken parcel may
try another and display it. Given `yarn test` it will run a small
unit test spec module.
